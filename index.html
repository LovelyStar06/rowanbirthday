  <p>Happy Birthday my amazing and kind boyfriend. I hope that you enjoyed your day today. I wish I was there to celebrate but this will have to do for now. Hopefully, next year, I can give you a in person birthday kiss. </p>
  <p>Before I left, I said I packed away my laptop. I kind of lied. I was working on this while we were talking.</p>
